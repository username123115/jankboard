# """ Research """

Ok I wanna do a reversible pcb with an E-INK display because i'm quirky and unique and not like all the other boarders
And also lets just SMD everything because why not surely nothing can go wrong in the soldering process

Low profile switches
USBC power 
    - Ok it'd be super funny if I used a usb 2.0 socket and just bussed the i2c over the D+/D- pairs (likely an incredibly dumb idea idk)

FPC connector use [this](https://cdn.amphenol-cs.com/media/wysiwyg/files/documentation/datasheet/flex/ffc_fpc_050mm_f31l.pdf)

EINK use [this](https://www.waveshare.com/1.02inch-e-paper.htm)
